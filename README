Step 1: Download and UnZip the Project
Step 2: Import the Project in IntelliJ IDEA
Step 3: Run the Application
Step 4: Csv file is already there in the project.
Step 5: Parsing of file can be done using a cronjob, so that every request, parsing can be avoided.
Step 6: now Call another API for (http://localhost:8080/api/stock/averageCloseRateOverPeriod?month=6&year=72&day=2)

As per my understanding the Response for averageCloseRate over the specified period.

1. If user passes the request parameter as day, month and year, then close rate of that day is returned
2. If user passes the request parameter as month and year, then close rate of all the days in that month is returned.
3. If user passes the request parameter as year, then month wise average close rate for that year is returned.
